# I18n::JSON

[![](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-json/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-json/actions?query=workflow%3Atests)

Export I18n translations to JSON. A perfect fit if you want to export
translations to JavaScript.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "i18n-json"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install i18n-json

## Usage

About patterns:

- Patterns can use `*` as a wildcard and can appear more than once.
  - `*` will include everything
  - `*.messages.*`
- Patterns starting with `!` are excluded.
  - `!*.activerecord.*` will exclude all ActiveRecord translations.

The config file:

```yml
---
translations:
  - file: app/frontend/locales/en.json
    patterns:
      - "en.*"
      - "!en.*.activerecord.errors"

  - file: app/frontend/locales/:locale.json
    patterns:
      - "*"
```

The code API:

```ruby
require "i18n-json"

I18n::JSON.call(config_file: "config/i18n.yml")
```

The CLI API:

```console
$ i18n-json init --config config/i18n.yml
$ i18n-json export --config config/i18n.yml --require config/boot.rb
```

You can also automatically export translations when file changes using [guard-i18n-json](https://github.com/fnando/guard-i18n-json).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
